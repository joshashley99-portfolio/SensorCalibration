# SensorCalibration
This project simulates an automated calibration process for an oxygen concentration sensor.  Known gas concentrations are introduced, readings are sampled, and the input range is adjusted using math operations to ensure accurate sensor scaling.

This video focuses on demonstrating the calibration process in action. I don’t go in-depth on every piece of ladder logic here — that would take a while — but if you're interested in the full logic and structure behind it, feel free to check out the included PDFs for the project description and ladder logic. You could also download the .rss file if you'd like but be aware it may not work properly in environments other than Logix500. 

Side note, this project was a mac daddy, extremely difficult for me to get to work properly and took a good bit of testing and trial and error to get it working properly.  Additionally my explanation of the calibration process and input range adjusting may not be the clearest or most concise. Apologies there; To make up for this,  I have included a bit of a more technical explanation in the project description.
