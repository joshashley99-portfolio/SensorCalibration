# SensorCalibration
This project simulates an automated calibration process for an oxygen concentration sensor.  Known gas concentrations are introduced, readings are sampled, and the input range is adjusted using math operations to ensure accurate sensor scaling.

Please feel free to read the project description pdf for a better overview of how the calibration cycle operates. Also free to watch the video for a narrated video of operation. Also feel free to read through the ladder logic pdfs or download the .rss file yourself.
