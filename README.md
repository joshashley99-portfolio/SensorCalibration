# SensorCalibration
This project simulates an automated calibration process for an oxygen concentration sensor.  Known gas concentrations are introduced, readings are sampled, and the input range is adjusted using math operations to ensure accurate sensor scaling.

Please feel free to read the project description pdf for a better overview of how the calibration cycle operates. Feel free to watch the video for a narrated video of operation. Also feel free to read through the ladder logic pdfs or download the .rss file yourself. 

Side note, this project was a mac daddy, extremely difficult for me to get to work properly and took a good bit of testing and trial and error to get it working properly.  Additionally my explanation of the calibration process and input range adjusting may not be the clearest or most concise. Apologies there; To make up for this,  I have included a bit of a more technical explanation in the project description.
