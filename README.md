# SensorCalibration
This project simulates an automated calibration process for an oxygen concentration sensor.  Known gas concentrations are introduced, readings are sampled, and the input range is adjusted using math operations to ensure accurate sensor scaling.

These videos focus on demonstrating the calibration process in action. I don’t go in-depth on every piece of logic here — that would take a while — but if you're interested in the full logic and structure behind it, feel free to check out the included PDFs for the project description and ladder logic. You could also download the .rss file if you'd like but be aware it may not work properly in environments other than Logix500.
