# SensorCalibration
This project simulates an automated calibration process for an oxygen concentration sensor.  Known gas concentrations are introduced, readings are sampled, and the input range is adjusted using math operations to ensure accurate sensor scaling.

Link to a second video with HMI implementation/Demo https://youtu.be/G-mfg7plozc This is a part two of the sensor calibration demo.  For this video, I've built an HMI screen using EasyBuilder5000 so we can activate our calibration process from a different screen and also have a better visual of what's happening.  This portion of the project was also made to give myself more practice building HMI screens and getting them to communicate with my PLC/Emulate Programs.

These videos focus on demonstrating the calibration process in action. I don’t go in-depth on every piece of logic here — that would take a while — but if you're interested in the full logic and structure behind it, feel free to check out the included PDFs for the project description and ladder logic. You could also download the .rss file if you'd like but be aware it may not work properly in environments other than Logix500. 

Side note, this project was a mac daddy, extremely difficult for me to get to work properly and took a good bit of testing and trial and error to get it working properly.  Additionally my explanation of the calibration process and input range adjusting may not be the clearest or most concise. Apologies there; To make up for this,  I have included a bit of a more technical explanation in the project description.
